# \# 🚕 Ride Sharing Dynamic Pricing Engine (MySQL Project)

# 

# \## 📌 Project Overview

# 

# This project implements a Dynamic Ride Pricing Engine using MySQL.  

# The system analyzes ride demand patterns and simulates surge pricing based on real ride-sharing data.

# 

# The project demonstrates:

# 

# \- Advanced SQL queries

# \- Window functions (RANK, LAG, Moving Average)

# \- Demand analysis

# \- Revenue analytics

# \- Driver performance tracking

# \- Surge pricing simulation logic

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🗂 Dataset Information

# 

# The dataset contains:

# 

# \- Ride ID

# \- Request Time

# \- Pickup \& Dropoff Locations

# \- Latitude \& Longitude

# \- Ride Distance (miles)

# \- Fare Amount ($)

# \- Payment Method

# \- Driver ID

# \- Vehicle Type

# \- Traffic Condition

# \- Peak Hours

# \- Day of Week

# \- Public Holiday

# \- User Rating

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🛠 Technologies Used

# 

# \- MySQL

# \- SQL Window Functions

# \- Aggregation \& Grouping

# \- CASE Statements

# \- STR\_TO\_DATE() for datetime conversion

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 📊 Key Business Insights Generated

# 

# \- Total Revenue \& Ride Volume

# \- Hourly Demand Trends

# \- Revenue by Location

# \- Peak Demand Days

# \- Top Earning Drivers

# \- Average User Ratings by Vehicle Type

# \- Surge Multiplier Simulation Based on Demand

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🔥 Surge Pricing Logic

# 

# Surge multiplier applied based on ride demand:

# 

# \- Demand > 50 → 2.0x

# \- Demand > 30 → 1.5x

# \- Otherwise → 1.0x

# 

# This simulates real-world ride-sharing surge pricing behavior.

#

# 

# \## 📈 Advanced SQL Concepts Used

# 

# \- RANK() Window Function

# \- LAG() for ride growth analysis

# \- Moving Averages

# \- Aggregations with GROUP BY

# \- Conditional logic with CASE

# \- Date-time conversion using STR\_TO\_DATE()
