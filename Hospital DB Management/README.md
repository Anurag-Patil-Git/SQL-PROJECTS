\# 🏥 Hospital Database Management System — SQL Project



This project represents a complete end-to-end \*\*relational database design and SQL analytics case study\*\* built on a Hospital Management dataset.  



The objective is to simulate real-world hospital operations including:



\- Patient management  

\- Physician \& nurse coordination  

\- Appointment scheduling  

\- Admission tracking  

\- Room allocation  

\- Medication prescriptions  

\- Procedure certification validation

\## 📌 Project Overview



Modern hospitals generate complex relational data across multiple departments.



This project focuses on:



\- Designing a \*\*fully normalized relational database\*\*

\- Establishing \*\*proper primary \& foreign key relationships\*\*

\- Writing analytical SQL queries to answer real-world hospital scenarios

\- Validating physician certifications against performed procedures



The database was implemented using \*\*MySQL\*\*.

\## 🧠 What I Did in This Project — Step-by-Step Process



| Phase | Activities |

|-------|------------|

| 📂 \*\*Phase 1 — Database Design\*\* | Created ER-based relational schema |

| 🧱 \*\*Phase 2 — Table Creation\*\* | Implemented 15 interrelated tables |

| 🔗 \*\*Phase 3 — Relationship Mapping\*\* | Applied primary \& foreign key constraints |

| 🧪 \*\*Phase 4 — Data Insertion\*\* | Inserted structured hospital sample data |

| 🔍 \*\*Phase 5 — Query Development\*\* | Solved 15 real-world SQL business problems |

| 📊 \*\*Phase 6 — Advanced Logic\*\* | Used joins, aggregation, subqueries \& date comparisons |

\## 🗂 Database Entities



The system consists of the following major entities:



\- Physician  

\- Nurse  

\- Patient  

\- Department  

\- Affiliated\_With  

\- Appointment  

\- Medication  

\- Prescribes  

\- Procedures  

\- Trained\_In  

\- Stay (Admissions)  

\- Room  

\- Block  

\- On\_Call  

\- Undergoes  



This structure reflects a real hospital’s operational workflow.

\## 🎯 Key Business Questions Solved



✔ Which physicians are not primarily affiliated with any department?  

✔ Which patients were treated by which primary physicians?  

✔ How many physicians did each patient consult?  

✔ How many unique patients used examination room C?  

✔ Which nurses assisted in which rooms?  

✔ Which patients required no nurse assistance?  

✔ What medications were prescribed and by whom?  

✔ Which floors have the minimum available rooms?  

✔ Where is each admitted patient staying?  

✔ Did any physician perform procedures after certification expiry?  



(15 Structured SQL Queries Implemented)

\## 📊 Key Insights



📌 Patient–Physician relationships can be tracked through structured joins.  

📌 Room utilization can be analyzed floor-wise and block-wise.  

📌 Nurse assistance patterns are visible via appointment mapping.  

📌 Certification expiry validation ensures compliance tracking.  

📌 The relational schema accurately models real-world hospital workflow.
